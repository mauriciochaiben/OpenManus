# Multi-Agent Architecture - OpenManus

## Overview
OpenManus utilizes a sophisticated multi-agent architecture that enables complex task execution through specialized AI agents working in coordination.

## Architecture Components

### Agent Types
1. **Manus Agent**: Core coordination and general operations
2. **Browser Agent**: Web navigation and data collection
3. **SWE Agent**: Software engineering and code development
4. **Data Analysis Agent**: Data processing and visualization

### Flow Management
- **FlowFactory**: Creates and manages different flow types
- **Multi-Agent Flow**: Coordinates multiple agents for complex tasks
- **Single Agent Flow**: Handles simple tasks with one agent

### Decision System
- **Task Complexity Analysis**: Determines if task requires multiple agents
- **Agent Selection**: Chooses appropriate agents based on task requirements
- **Execution Planning**: Plans and coordinates agent interactions

### Coordination Tools
- **Distributed Memory**: Shared memory for agent communication
- **Planning Tool**: Strategic task planning capabilities
- **Coordination Tool**: Inter-agent communication and synchronization

## Implementation Status

## Usage Examples

### Simple Task (Single Agent)
```python
# Mathematical calculation
"Calculate the square root of 144"
# â†’ Uses Manus Agent only
```

### Complex Task (Multi-Agent)
```python
# Research and report generation
"Research AI trends in 2025 and create a comprehensive report"
# â†’ Uses Browser Agent + Manus Agent + coordination
```

### Very Complex Task (Full Multi-Agent)
```python
# Software development with research
"Research best practices for microservices, then create a Python implementation"
# â†’ Uses Browser Agent + SWE Agent + Manus Agent + planning
```

## Configuration

The system automatically determines task complexity and selects appropriate agents based on:
- Task domain analysis
- Required tools and capabilities
- Estimated execution time
- Resource availability

## Monitoring and Debugging

- Real-time progress tracking via WebSocket
- Comprehensive logging system
- Agent interaction monitoring
- Performance metrics collection
